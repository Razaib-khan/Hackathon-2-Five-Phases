# Prompt History Record

## Original Prompt

[Pasted text #2 +85 lines]

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for the Five Phase Hackathon platform. The specification includes:

- User scenarios and testing with 5 prioritized user stories covering registration, phase progression, team formation, project submission, and admin management
- Functional requirements defining system capabilities for the five-phase hackathon process
- Key entities representing the core data models
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for the hackathon platform

The specification addresses all five phases of the hackathon: Registration, Ideation, Development, Submission, and Presentation/Judging. All requirements have been documented with clear acceptance criteria, and edge cases have been identified.

A quality checklist was also created and validated, confirming that all requirements have been met and the specification is ready for the next phase.
