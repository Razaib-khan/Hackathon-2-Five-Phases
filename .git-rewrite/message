fix(workflows): use npm install instead of npm ci

npm ci requires an existing package-lock.json file.
Since we don't have one yet, use npm install which will
generate the lock file on first run.

This fixes the GitHub Actions workflow failures for both
deploy-github-pages.yml and frontend-ci.yml workflows.
