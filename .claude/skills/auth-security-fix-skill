# Authentication Security Fix Skill

This skill handles authentication security fixes, particularly around password validation, bcrypt limitations, and passlib compatibility.

## Purpose
- Fix password validation issues before hashing
- Address bcrypt 72-byte limit enforcement
- Fix passlib/bcrypt compatibility issues
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
- Ensure secure password hashing practices

## Usage
This skill should be invoked when authentication security issues are identified that need to be fixed.

## Process
1. Analyze the current authentication implementation
2. Identify specific issues (password length validation, bcrypt compatibility, etc.)
3. Implement fixes to ensure proper password validation before hashing
4. Add proper error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes
5. Verify that authentication flows work correctly without 500 errors
