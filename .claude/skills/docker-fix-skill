# Docker Configuration Fix Skill

This skill handles Docker configuration fixes, particularly around multi-stage builds, health checks, and proper initialization sequences.

## Purpose
- Fix Dockerfile configurations
- Address build-time vs runtime issues
- Configure proper health check endpoints
- Optimize multi-stage builds
- Handle environment-specific configurations

## Usage
This skill should be invoked when Docker configuration issues are identified that need to be fixed.

## Process
1. Analyze the current Docker configuration
2. Identify specific issues (missing health checks, incorrect build sequences, etc.)
3. Implement fixes to ensure proper container startup and health checks
4. Verify that containers can communicate properly in a multi-container environment
